template.name: "1:Simple container toolchain"
template.description: "2:With this toolchain, you can develop and deploy a Docker container application. By default, the toolchain uses a sample Node.js \"Hello World\" app, or you can link to your own GitHub repository. This toolchain is preconfigured for continuous delivery, source control, issue tracking, and online editing.\n\n **First-time containers service users**: Make sure that your containers service is correctly set up by [identifying the image repository for your organization](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/containers/container_planning_org_ov.html#container_planning_namespace). Also, check your org container quotas by clicking **Manage Organizations**, selecting your org, and clicking **Edit Org > Quota > Containers > Edit**. For more information about getting started with the IBM Containers service, see [this tutorial](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/containers/container_gettingstarted_tutorial.html#container_gettingstarted_tutorial_lesson_1).\n\nThis toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service. If an instance of that service isn't already in your organization, when you click **Create**, it is automatically added at no cost to you. For more information and terms, see the [Bluemix catalog](/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/).\n\nTo get started, click **Create**."
template.gettingStarted: "3:**Your toolchain is ready!**\n**Quick start:** Commit a change to the Git repo to trigger a new build and deployment. For step-by-step instructions, see the [tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/devops/method/tutorials/tutorial_toolchain_container) for this toolchain."
