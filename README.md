This Hello World application uses Docker with Node.js and includes a DevOps toolchain that is preconfigured for continuous delivery, source control, issue tracking, and online editing, and deploying to the IBM Bluemix Containers service.

To get started, click **Create toolchain**.

[![Deploy To Bluemix](https://console.bluemix.net/devops/graphics/create_toolchain_button.png)](https://console.bluemix.net/devops/setup/deploy/?repository=https%3A//github.com/open-toolchain/simple-container-toolchain)

**First-time container service users**: Make sure that your containers service is correctly set up by [identifying the image repository for your organization](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/containers/container_creating_ov.html#container_namespace). 

For more information about getting started with the IBM Containers service, see [this tutorial](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/containers/container_gettingstarted_tutorial_lesson1.html#container_gettingstarted_tutorial_lesson_1).
